To automatically generate client code for consuming an API in an Angular application, tools like OpenAPI Generator or Swagger Codegen can be employed. These tools utilize the API’s OpenAPI Specification (formerly known as Swagger) to generate TypeScript classes, which act as wrappers for the API endpoints.

```ng-openapi-gen : https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-openapi-gen```

Manually integrating APIs can be a time-consuming and error-prone process. This is where tools like Swagger and ng-openapi-gen come into play. We will see how you can use Swagger and ng-openapi-gen to speed up API integration in your Angular projects.

You can write OpenAPI definitions in YAML or JSON. In this guide, we use only YAML examples but JSON works equally well. A sample OpenAPI 3.0 definition written in YAML looks like:

```https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/basic-structure/```

**To automatically generate client code for consuming an API in an Angular application, tools like ng-openapi-gen (doesn’t need to install JAVA) or OpenAPI Generator (need to install JAVA) or Swagger Codegen can be employed. These tools utilize an OpenAPI Specification (formerly known as Swagger) to define the API structure and operations, enabling the generation of TypeScript service classes and model classes, simplifying API calls and response handling within the Angular application. The generated code uses Angular’s HttpClient for making HTTP requests.**

## ng-openapi-gen: A Tool for Angular Developers
ng-openapi-gen is a command-line tool that automatically generates TypeScript client code from OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specifications. This is incredibly useful for Angular developers because it reduces the need for manually writing boilerplate code to interact with an API.

### How ng-openapi-gen Works
Parsing the OpenAPI spec: ng-openapi-gen reads the OpenAPI definition of an API.
Code Generation: It generates TypeScript classes and services that correspond to the API endpoints and models defined in the OpenAPI spec.
Why Use ng-openapi-gen for Angular Projects?
API integration often involves repetitive tasks, such as defining models, services, and handling errors. ng-openapi-gen takes care of these tasks by automatically generating code, reducing the risk of human error and speeding up development.

### Advantages:

  -  Time Savings: No need to manually write client-side code for each API.
  -  Consistency: Ensures that the frontend code is always aligned with the backend API.
  -  Error Handling: It generates code that includes error handling logic based on the OpenAPI spec.
